# @forloopy/nameparser

**@forloopy/nameparser** is an open-source and free-to-use library for parsing full names. Designed for NodeJS developers, this lightweight library extracts details such as first name, middle name, last name, title, and gender from a given name input. Written in loose TypeScript (with plans to include comprehensive types and definitions in the future), it provides flexibility for developers while maintaining ease of use.
